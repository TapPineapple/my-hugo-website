  ### Why only 2 major parties?
* Institutional forces!
  * -Electoral system facilitate 2 party vs. multi-party systems
* Elsewhere:
  * Multi-party systems
  * seem to be managing very well
  * more parties = coalition governments
* Mutli-party coalitions government
  * The coalition government
  * Israel eight-party coalitions that unseated Netanyahu
* Why a two-party system?
  * Single member districts
    * -plurality wins a seat

  * winner takes all rules
  * 'law':SMDs cause 2 party systems
    * many exceptions

* Wnner-take-all rules
  * Psychological /behavioral:
  * Duverger's Law; fear of wasted vote
  * vote your second choice to avoid least preferred candidate from winning
  * but people some still vote 'third party'
    * when do people vote for 'third' party in US presidential elections?
* Summary
  * Winner take all
  * people don't want to waste their votes.
  * Ballot access laws
    * set by state legislators
    * catch 22
  * minor party must post x% in statewide race to have access for their candidate in the next election

* Prospects
* ranked choice voting
  * the australian system
  * sort of majoritarian, but
  * allows supporters of minor parties to express sincere vote in first round
  * people can really vote for who they want without worrying about their vote being lost.

  * extending protections from the Bill of Rights to the state governments
*  Prosecuted under NY criminal anarchy act of 1902; met 
*  14th amendment

  * In first trimester, fetus is not viable so individual right out weighs state interest in regulating
* Dobbs, 2022
  * States have interest in reglating any stage of pregnacy
