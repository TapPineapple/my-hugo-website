Welcome to my Webiste! My name is Adin, I am currently studying Cybersecurity at Western Washington University and Whatcom Community College. I'm working as a student employee with WWU ResTek as a Server Admin.

I like building servers and trying to break them (sometimes without trying), I also like to reverse engineer games.
