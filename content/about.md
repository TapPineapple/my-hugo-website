Welcome to my Website! My name is Adin, I am currently studying Cybersecurity at Western Washington University and Whatcom Community College. I'm working as a student employee with WWU doing IT work.

I like building servers and trying to break them (usually not on purpose), I also like to reverse engineer games.
